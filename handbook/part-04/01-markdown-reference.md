# Markdown Reference

> See  raw source for the page to find markdown used

## Headers

Following are available header  styles

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

## Emphasis

* Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

* Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

* Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

* Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

##  List

1. Ordered  list
2. Another item
	* first element of unordered sub - list 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
	1. first element of unordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. 
   Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);

## Block quotes

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 

## Paragraphs

First paragraph
Line that will collocate with the First Paragraph. 

Line that will start from  a new paragraph.
